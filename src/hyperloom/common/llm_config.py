"""LLM gateway ownership: env resolution *and* client construction.

:func:`get_openai_client` / :func:`get_async_openai_client` and their Anthropic
counterparts :func:`get_anthropic_client` / :func:`get_async_anthropic_client`
are the only sanctioned places in Hyperloom that instantiate an LLM transport.
Callers ask this module for a client instead of reading credentials themselves,
so provider selection stays one decision rather than one per call site. The
matching single-shot helpers (:func:`achat_completion`, :func:`aresponse`,
:func:`anthropic_messages` and their twins) own the request shapes, so no caller
hand-builds a payload or an endpoint path either.

Single-turn Anthropic work goes through :func:`anthropic_completion` /
:func:`aanthropic_completion`, which additionally own *transport* selection: the
Messages API rejects a Claude Max/Pro subscription token, so that credential is
served by a tool-free single-turn Claude CLI session instead. Both transports
return the same :class:`AnthropicMessageResult`, so a call site does not encode
which credential shape a deployment carries.

Hyperloom serves three deployment shapes — Anthropic-only, OpenAI-compatible
only, and both. Explicit configuration for a protocol always wins; when the
OpenAI side is absent, :func:`resolve_openai_client_config` falls back to the
Anthropic gateway so an Anthropic-only deployment can still drive the
OpenAI-protocol call sites.

Clients are deliberately **not** cached or shared. Both transports wrap an
``httpx.AsyncClient`` whose connection pool binds to the event loop that first
uses it, and Hyperloom starts a fresh loop per run / phase, so a process-wide
cache would hand a second loop a pool it cannot use. Credentials are also not
stable for the life of the process: preflight rewrites the provider env, and
callers may pass an explicit ``env`` mapping. Owning objects (``CodexBackend``,
``ProposalScorer``, ``CriticAgentBackend``) already hold one client each for
their own lifetime, which is the scope that actually matches an event loop.
