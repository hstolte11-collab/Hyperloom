    """Run the quantization-agent once before the optimization loop.

    No-op unless ``--quantize "<prompt>"`` was passed. When set, this drives
    AMD Quark PTQ from the prompt via the ``quantization_request_handlers``
    adapter, then rewrites ``args.model`` (+ ``$MODEL_PATH``) to the exported
    quantized model so every downstream phase (baseline / profile / sweep /
    kernel) optimizes the quantized model instead of the source.

    Contract:
      * Reached only on the fresh-launch path; a resumed session takes its
        model from the manifest and never re-quantizes.
      * On a failed/blocked quantization the process exits with code 3 —
        we must not silently fall through and optimize the un-quantized
        source model when the user explicitly asked for quantization.
      * On a scheme/GPU mismatch (e.g. an MI355X-only scheme on an mi300x
        target), the structured ``--quantize-scheme`` path reports the error
        and *skips* quantization, then continues optimizing the un-quantized
        model. The mismatch is a config error caught before any Quark work
        runs, not a mid-run failure, so the run proceeds rather than aborting.
        The skip is made **detectable** so a launcher / UI never mistakes the
        run for quantized: a ``QUANTIZATION_SKIPPED:`` marker line on stdout
        plus the ``$HYPERLOOM_QUANTIZATION_SKIPPED`` env var (set to the reason).

    Args:
        args: Parsed CLI arguments; reads ``quantize`` / ``quantize_scheme`` /
            ``gpu_type`` and rewrites ``args.model`` in place to the exported
            quantized model path on success.
