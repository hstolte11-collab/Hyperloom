"""Route gate for KernelForge's source-to-FlyDSL rewrite of one Forge attempt.

The generic per-kernel route optimizes a kernel in its own language and
consumes a schema-1 ``best_result.json``. The rewrite route instead asks
KernelForge to port the kernel to FlyDSL and publish a framework apply-back
patch. That is a different producer contract, so an attempt may only switch
routes when the operator opted in, the candidate matches the supported MVP
shape, and the installed producer advertises the protocol/schema/driver
versions this consumer knows how to read.

Every verdict carries a stable reason code. A negative verdict is never a
kernel skip: the attempt stays on the generic forge-loop route untouched.
