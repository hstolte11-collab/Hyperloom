"""Agent review of the deterministically produced kernel-candidate table.

The deterministic tiers fail in a way no "fill in the blanks" pass can catch:
they do not come up empty, they come up *confidently wrong*. A launcher frame
proves who launched a kernel, not who defines it; a keyword grep on ``dispatch``
lands on whichever vendor header mentions the word. Both produce a real,
existing, root-resident path that passes every mechanical check.

Reviewing that needs the context the tiers do not have -- what the model is,
how it is being served, what the trace actually recorded -- and enough of the
framework tree to confirm a file really defines the kernel it is credited with.
Rather than pre-loading any of that into a prompt, this hands the agent the
*paths* and lets it read what it needs.

Three properties keep the added freedom bounded:

* **Proposals only.** The agent may revise where a kernel lives, whether it is
  worth dispatching, and the operand dims to tune it against. It may not touch
  the trace's own measurements -- GPU share, duration, launch count -- nor the
  keys the row is identified by. Those carry the impact ranking, the closing
  gain figure and the attempt ledger. :data:`IMMUTABLE_FIELDS` is enforced here,
  not requested in prose.

  Operand dims are the exception, and deliberately so: a graph replay has no
  CPU-side parent op, so the profiler records no arguments for exactly the
  kernels that dominate a captured model, and the field arrives empty. Refusing
  the review's answer there does not preserve a measurement -- it hands the
  choice to a tuning backend that cannot see the serving configuration. Review
  dims therefore carry their own provenance so a later reader can still tell a
  recovered shape from a computed one.
* **Nothing is taken on faith.** A revised path must exist under a known
  framework root. This is not a correctness check; it stops an invented path
  from being written.
* **Nothing is destroyed.** Every revision records ``previous_source_file`` and
  ``previous_method``, and the pre-review table is kept beside the reviewed one,
  so a bad review is auditable and reversible.

The session gets no tool that can write to the code under optimization, and that
is the whole of the guarantee -- there is no detection layer behind it, because
one is only worth its false positives if the thing it watches for is reachable.

On the Claude backend: reading and searching are pre-approved, ``Write`` is
refused outside ``run_dir``, and everything else -- a shell included -- is
denied by a default-deny callback, so a tool added by a later SDK arrives
refused rather than pre-authorised. On the Codex backend the containment is the
OS sandbox: this stage pins ``workspace-write`` rather than inheriting the
deployment's mode, so it cannot run under ``bypass``. The two are not
equivalent and :func:`_run_codex_session` says where they differ.

    What is equivalent: writes to the framework tree are refused. What differs:
    the refusal is the OS sandbox rather than a per-call callback, so this
    session has a shell and Codex's own file tools where the Claude one has
    Read/Grep/Glob and nothing else. That is acceptable only because the
    sandbox holds, which is why ``sandbox_mode`` is pinned here instead of
    inherited: ``writable_roots`` *widens* ``workspace-write``, it does not
    impose it, and under a deployment-level ``bypass`` it goes unread entirely
    -- which would leave this stage with no containment at all while the
    docstrings claimed otherwise. Stating the mode outranks the environment, so
    a ``bypass`` deployment still gets a contained review.

    Also bounded only on total wall clock. The Claude path additionally bounds
    each wait for the next message, which catches a stalled gateway stream in
    minutes rather than at the overall timeout; the one-shot Codex entry point
    exposes no stream to bound. A stalled Codex review therefore costs the full
