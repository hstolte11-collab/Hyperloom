    """Drop the profiler-start transient from the head of a torch trace.

    ``torch.profiler.start()`` is a local, unfenced call whose cost varies by
    seconds across ranks, and SGLang does not barrier after it. The ranks whose
    profiler comes up first therefore reach the first collective of the step and
    spin there until the slowest peer arrives. A spin-waiting collective is
    charged as GPU-busy time, so that wait lands in the trace as one enormous
    kernel at the head of the window: on the reference capture a single
    ``cross_device_reduce_2stage`` held 15747 ms of a 16805 ms window, leaving
    Compute% at 5.75% and tripping the low-compute gate that suppresses the
    entire hot-kernel candidate list.

    The collective is self-healing -- releasing it re-synchronises every rank --
    so the contamination is confined to the first step and everything after it is
    already steady (32.94 ms +/- 0.3 across the following 127 steps on the same
    capture). Cutting the leading outlier steps therefore recovers an honest
    window without touching instrumentation, and keeps ``shape_discovery`` and
    the ``with_stack`` frames its shapes ride on fully intact.

    Detection is on step duration, not on any kernel name, so the same guard
    catches other head-of-window transients (first-replay JIT, KV-pool growth)
    without knowing what they are. Durations are compared against the median of
    the step's *own phase*: a mixed capture's prefill steps run one to two orders
    of magnitude longer than its decode steps, and against a whole-trace median
    the leading prefill steps -- the window
    ``--steady-state-mode=prefilldecode`` exists to analyse -- would all read as
    start-up noise. Only a *leading* run of outliers is cut: a slow step in the
    middle is real behaviour the splitter and the health gates should still see.

    The cut is applied per timeline rather than as one timestamp, because the
    host runs a step ahead of the device and the two spans interleave across the
    boundary. See the comment at the cut for what each single-point alternative
    loses. The two timelines are paired by position, never by annotation name;
    ``_host_step_starts`` has the reasoning.

    Step count is unaffected downstream: the splitter is invoked with
    ``--num-steps`` and caps its window there, so it still hands TraceLens
    exactly that many steps -- only which ones changes. The caller refuses the
    trim outright when fewer than ``--num-steps`` would remain.

    Args:
        src (Path): Raw per-rank trace, JSON or ``.gz``.
        dst (Path): Where the trimmed trace is written. Untouched when no trim
            is performed.
        outlier_factor (float): Multiple of the phase median above which a
            leading step is treated as a transient.
        min_steps (int): Fewest step annotations required before trimming.
        min_phase_steps (int): Samples a phase needs before its median is

    Prefers the merged annotated trace over rank/phase shards (the TraceLens

    Splitter output sorts last, and within a bucket the largest file leads.
    Both parts exist because of the same bug: the fragments used to share the
    default bucket with the raw capture, so alphabetical order decided, and
    ``decode_only_steady_state_...`` beats ``rank_0.trace.json.gz`` on the first

    no GPU kernels failed the CPU-only preflight outright, and the one model
    whose fragment happened to hold 512 produced a roofline computed from 2.6%
    of its own trace, with no ceiling.

    Size is the part that does not depend on recognising a name. A real capture
    is orders of magnitude larger than a per-phase fragment or a sidecar like

    Defense-in-depth fallback for the candidate-extraction gap: surfaces ops
    that have no analysis.md reasoning-candidate block (so ``parse_analysis_md``
    dropped them) as raw candidates, ranked by per-op sidecar GPU time, so each
    flows through ``_finalize_candidates`` -> ``classify_patchability``.

    Any high-GPU-time op missing from ``existing_candidates`` is eligible (e.g.
    ``MoE_fused`` whose roofline is null). The patchability gate downstream still
    rejects vendor / native ops, so widening the net does not route non-patchable
    kernels to GEAK.

    Fires for ops that are (a) absent from ``existing_candidates`` by name and
    (b) at or above ``min_gpu_pct`` of total GPU time.

    Whenever ``total_window_us`` is known, ``gpu_pct`` is normalized against it
    -- the same denominator ``parse_analysis_md`` uses -- so both candidate
    sources stay comparable inside one ranked ``hot_kernels[]``. The sidecar's
    own percentage column is preferred only as a fallback, because its
    denominator is not the trace wall span: ``ops_summary.csv`` normalizes
    against total *op* time, which excludes collectives, so on a comm-dominated
    trace its percentages run an order of magnitude above the end-to-end share.
    Mixing the two bases in one field silently produced unrankable candidate
    lists (a fallback op at "23.5% GPU" outranking an analysis.md op at "4.7%
    GPU" when the true e2e shares were 0.5% and 4.7%). The basis actually used
    is recorded on each candidate as ``gpu_pct_basis``.

    Note this bypasses rather than repairs the ambiguity: ``_RANK_PCT_KEYS``
    still maps both ``% of compute time`` and ``%e2e`` onto one ``gpu_pct``, so
    a run with no ``gpu_timeline.csv`` to supply ``total_window_us`` falls back
    to whatever the sidecar reported and carries the original mixed-basis
    hazard -- now labelled ``sidecar_reported`` rather than silent. Splitting
    those aliases into separate fields is the real repair and is not done here.

    Args:
        skill_output_dir: The TraceLens skill output directory to scan.
        existing_candidates: Candidates already extracted from analysis.md.
        top_k: Maximum number of recovered candidates to return.

            admission is unchanged by the reporting basis (see
            ``_admission_pct``).
        total_window_us: Wall span of the analyzed trace, in microseconds. When
            omitted or non-positive the function falls back to the sidecar's
