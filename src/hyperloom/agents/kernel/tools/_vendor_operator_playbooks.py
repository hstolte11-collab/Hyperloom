"""Vendor-operator-playbook registry: route a closed-source hot kernel to a
validated KernelForge *task bundle* instead of a source rewrite.

Most of the forge-submission pipeline assumes a hot kernel has an editable
device source file (``kernel_url`` -> in-place rewrite). Some vendor
operators -- mori's EP dispatch/combine all-to-all is the first case -- are
pip-installed compiled libraries with no such source, but do have a small,
named set of launch-config knobs that a KernelForge forge-loop task bundle
has already been validated to tune (see KernelForge PR #88's "Making this
real" section for the design rationale this module implements).

This is deliberately a narrow, explicit carve-out (one JSON registry, sibling
to the retired ``op_to_source.json``) rather than a general "config-tuning"
system: a candidate only gets vendor-playbook treatment when it matches a
registry entry by name.
