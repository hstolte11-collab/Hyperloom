"""CodexBackend — a reactor role driven by the Codex Agent SDK.

Hyperloom issues no bare LLM API calls: every agent runs inside an agent
runtime, so auth, sandboxing, turn timeouts and usage accounting have exactly
one owner. This backend is the OpenAI-side half of that contract for the
Coordinator, the mirror of :class:`ClaudeBackend` on the Anthropic side.

The intent transport is a provider-enforced structured output rather than
prose the model is asked to imitate. Each turn ships the JSON schema
:func:`build_intent_envelope_schema` renders from the *role's own* intent set,
so the legal ``intent_type`` values are the role record's — never a literal
that can fall behind it. Strict structured outputs cannot express a free-form
object, so the payload arrives as a JSON string; decoding it and handing the
result to :func:`validate_envelope` keeps payload checking identical to the
Claude path.

One :class:`CodexSession` is held across ticks, which is what makes the
backend honestly ``conversational``: the Coordinator can then push a thin
delta instead of the full session state every turn, and compaction has a
conversation to compact. The session owns a child process and a private state
directory, so the Coordinator closes it (:meth:`aclose`) when the run ends.

class CodexBackend:
    """Production Codex reactor backend. Implements :class:`Backend`.

    One behaviour differs from the Claude path and cannot be made to match. A
    thread's developer instructions are fixed when it starts, so a phase re-scope
    has to open a new thread, and the model's own reasoning and plan go with the
    old one. :meth:`needs_seed_for` makes the Coordinator push a full SEED across
    that seam, and the seam checkpoint that normally runs first carries the
    distilled memory over -- but that checkpoint is skipped when checkpointing is
    disabled or the conversation was never seeded, and then only SharedState
    survives. Claude resumes by ``session_id`` and keeps everything.

    Args:
        allowed_intents: The emitting role's intent set; becomes the enforced
            ``intent_type`` enum. Required, because a backend that guesses it
            is exactly the drift this transport exists to prevent.
        model: Codex model id.
        cwd: Session-private working directory for the agent's own scratch
            files. Deliberately not the session directory: under the
            ``workspace-write`` sandbox the model may read the whole
            filesystem but write only its declared roots, so session state
            stays out of reach.
        writable_roots: Extra roots the session may write; ``cwd`` is always
            included.
        sandbox_mode: One of ``CODEX_SANDBOX_MODES``; blank defers to the
            deployment's ``HYPERLOOM_CODEX_SANDBOX_MODE``.
        codex_bin: Optional Codex runtime path; the SDK resolves its own when
            empty.
        call_timeout_s: Wall-clock cap for one ``run()``. Env override:
            ``INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_CODEX_CALL_TIMEOUT_SEC``.
        env: Values overlaid on ``os.environ`` for the child process.
        retry_policy: Bounded backoff for transient SDK/gateway failures; env
            override via ``INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_LLM_RETRY_*`` (ATTEMPTS=1
            disables), shared with the Claude path.
        auth_mode: ``gateway`` (default, unchanged) or ``native_oauth``; passed
            straight to :class:`CodexSession`, which validates it.
        codex_home: The operator's existing ``CODEX_HOME`` for ``native_oauth``.
