"""Divide the KERNEL phase's remaining time between the lanes.

The phase currently has no allocation at all: each lane carries its own timeout,
those timeouts sum to far more than the phase ever gets, and whoever runs last is
starved by whoever ran first. Once forge decides how many kernels to work on, it
needs to be told a real number instead of inheriting a per-kernel default that
was never divided by anything.

Two decisions live here:

* **How much each lane gets.** Derived from time actually left, following the
  one lane that already does this correctly rather than a fixed per-kernel
  figure.
* **How many targets a lane may pick.** Its share divided by what one target
  costs at minimum. Overshooting is not a small loss: below its admission floor
  a target produces nothing at all, so picking one too many can cost the entire
  lane's budget rather than a fraction of it.
