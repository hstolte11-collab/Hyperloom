"""The hot-kernel list as handed to a self-nominating forge.

Three things separate this from ``kernel_candidates.json`` itself:

* **Undispatchable rows are kept.** The dispatch path filters them out before
  forge is ever called, which is how a hot kernel disappears with no error and
  no counter. A nominator that never sees those rows cannot rescue them, and
  cannot judge how much of the GPU is out of its reach.
* **Every row carries a judgeable class.** The routing gate's prose is reduced
  to ``reason_class`` by the shared classifier, so a consumer can skip the
  classes nothing can rescue without measuring them.
* **Session history is merged in.** How many times a kernel was already tried,
  and whether it was rejected, live in orchestrator state -- forge has no way to
  know either.

This is a projection, not a replacement: ``kernel_candidates.json`` keeps its
shape and its existing consumers, and the classifier is the same pure function
the resolution artifact uses, so the two can never disagree.
