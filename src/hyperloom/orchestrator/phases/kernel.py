        """Merge a GEMM candidate CSV with the runtime config.

        aiter's complete config is the merged superset of its top-level table and
        all matching ``model_configs/*.csv`` tables. The candidate CSV only has
        the shapes the tuner improved. Using it alone as the env override drops
        all other shapes' tuned entries, causing regression.

        Prefer the live ``/tmp/aiter_configs`` table when it exists. That cache is
        normally removed with the serving process, so fall back to rebuilding the
        same table from the installed aiter package. Overlay the candidate by the
        untuned schema's dispatch keys and write one self-contained CSV for E2E.

        Implemented on the stdlib ``csv`` module on purpose: this runs in the
        orchestrator process, which must not carry a hard pandas dependency
        (pandas is not declared in ``pyproject.toml`` and is absent from the
        ``.[test,ci]`` CI environment -- importing it there raises
        ``ModuleNotFoundError`` and every candidate is silently rejected).
        Values are carried through as text, so a config round-trips byte-for-byte
        instead of being re-formatted by a dataframe writer.

        Returns the merged file path, or None if merging fails.
