"""Adapter: drive the quantization-agent from hyperloom.inference_optimizer.

Thin shim between ``cli._run_quantization_prelude`` and the
``hyperloom.agents.quantization`` package. It builds an effective prompt
(source model path + export dir + the user's ``--quantize`` text), runs
``quantize_via_prompt`` once, and maps its ``QuantSkillRunResult.status`` to a
concrete decision:

  * ``success``                    -> return ``quantized_model_dir``
  * ``partial`` (model usable)     -> warn, then return ``quantized_model_dir``
  * ``partial`` (no usable model)  -> ``SystemExit(3)``
  * ``failed``                     -> ``SystemExit(3)``

A quantization failure is a hard stop for the whole run: this adapter never
silently falls through to optimize the un-quantized source model.
