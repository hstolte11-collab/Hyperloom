"""Consumer half of the nomination contract.

Mirrors ``hyperloom.orchestrator.kernel.nomination_request`` field for field.
The two halves are deliberately separate modules rather than a shared import:
forge stays independently importable, and ``PROTOCOL_VERSION`` is what keeps
them honest. Bump both together.

The seam a real implementation replaces is :func:`nominate`; everything else
here is shell -- read, validate, delegate, assemble.
