"""Placeholder nominator, kept in its own file so it can be replaced wholesale.

It exists to make the contract runnable end to end, not to be good at picking
kernels: it trusts Hyperloom's already-resolved rows and never looks at the
trace. A real nominator parses the trace, resolves the rows Hyperloom could not,
and splits the budget on evidence rather than evenly.
